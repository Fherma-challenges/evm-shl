# FHERMA FHE-EVM SHL Challenge

The Shift Left `SHL` opcode in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) performs a bitwise shift left operation on an integer value. This operation is used to shift the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions, effectively multiplying the number by $2^n$ where `n` is the number of positions shifted. This can be particularly useful for various arithmetic operations, encoding, or when dealing with binary data manipulation within smart contracts.

The objective of the challenge is to design an algorithm that performs a logical left shift on input encrypted under BGV or BFV.
